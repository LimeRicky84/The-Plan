# The-Plan
Class Project 1

The planner consists of a Month, Week and Day format.  It allows users to add projects onto a calendar.  The user can then view the calendar in an applicable format to see what is due and when.

## Directions for future development:

Themes - Change the color and appearance of the pages to better suit various user preferences.

Dropdown Functionality - Ability to open a menu and input events in every cell of the calendar.

Moment Alternatives - Moment is being kept current but is no longer supported.  A more current time API could increase functionality.
